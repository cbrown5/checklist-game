# Checklist game

Gamified checklist for getting ready. 
Made with Sonnet 4.6 and github copilot agent. 

Checklist rocket has a rocket that takes off. Made using Phaser. 

Prompt for game 2
```
Make a standalone html game in @/checklist-rocket.html. Use phaser for graphics. I've put the items for the checklist in the file. There are N checklists for N people. Allow the user to choose N. Default to N=2. Show each checklist as a column of checkboxes. Each player has a robot that is in parts. When each item is ticked, one of the parts is added to the robot. e.g. a leg, another leg, a torso, an arm etc... Once the very last item is ticked the robot finishes, and fires up a rocket and flies off into space. Make sophisticated graphics and include sounds effects. Think carefully to plan the game design before you work on implementation.
